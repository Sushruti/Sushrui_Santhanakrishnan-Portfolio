> _Aren't we all fascinated by the world under water? And we all definitely want to experience it, everyone wants to try scuba diving atleast once in their lifetime. And who is to say if it becomes a passion or a hobby. But do we go beyond the fascination of seeing fishes and corals up close? Have we taken a moment to think about the possible effects we might have on marine ecosystems? Well, I hope this will help all of us understand that while having a hobby is great, its equally important that we practice it sustainably._

# Outline

Scuba diving has become one of the most popular marine recreational activities worldwide, attracting millions of participants each year. This surge in popularity can be attributed to several factors, including advancements in diving technology, increased affordability of dive certifications, and the rise of ecotourism, which promotes immersive experiences in natural environments (Garrod & Gössling, 2008). The unique beauty of coral reefs, their immense diversity, and the aura of tropical life and leisure attract millions of people from all around the world. Reefs are mainstays of large human populations, providing sources of livelihood for millions by supplying food, construction materials and resources for tourism. However, while diving provides significant economic advantages, it also raises concerns about its potential environmental impact. From the ecological perspective, coral reefs are the most biologically diverse shallow water marine ecosystems but are being degraded world-wide by human activities and climate warming.

While diving provides significant economic advantages, it also raises concerns about its potential environmental impact. Frequent human interaction with delicate coral reef ecosystems can lead to unintended damage, particularly in high-traffic dive sites, where divers may accidentally disturb marine life or contribute to coral degradation through direct contact and increased sedimentation (Roche et al., 2016).

### Defining the Project

In a sentence _this study examines the relationship between scuba diving as a recreation and how it might affect marine ecosystems._

This study will analyze the impact of recreational scuba diving on marine ecosystems by examining data on the most popular dive sites worldwide and identifying the most common types of diver contact that cause ecological damage. Using sources such as tourism statistics, scientific research, and environmental reports, the study will map the most frequently visited dive locations and assess how diver interactions—such as fin kicks, poor buoyancy control, and direct contact with coral—contribute to reef degradation. Drawing from Sumanapala et al. (2022), the study will highlight patterns in diver-induced disturbances and evaluate management strategies aimed at minimizing environmental harm. By presenting visual data through charts and graphs, the study aims to illustrate the correlation between diver activity and ecosystem stress, ultimately providing insights into sustainable diving practices and conservation efforts that can mitigate negative impacts on marine biodiversity.

### Who is this study intended for?

While the results from the study could be used by the general public to create awareness, this study would be most useful to people who are interested in or practice scuba diving as a hobby. The study would illustrate ways in which recreational diving affects marine ecosystems, but also provide actionable strategies that could help educate inexperienced divers on safe practices to follow while diving.

### What is the call for action?

- Provide resources that are publicy accessible, websites or blogs, to help educate recreational divers on safe proactices to follow while diving
- Create breifing videos that can be to or accessed dive schools or centers that train recreational divers
- Allow inexperienced divers to practice dive skills in controlled conditions such as pools

These are incremental steps that can be taken from the level of an individual to a group of people who are interested in learning how to scuba dive. 

### Project narrative

1. Introducing scuba diving and marine ecosystems
   - presenting the rise in popularity of recreational scuba diving
   - introduing marine ecosystems and coral reefs, how it is affected by human activities and why is it important to protect it
2. Dive site popularity - Global
   - visually representing the most popular dive sites and approximately how many people visit it
3. Common diver contact
   - identifying the common types of diver contact
   - visualizing data that represnts what type of contact is most common in dive sites
4. Consequence of diver contact
   - identifying coral degradation patterns
5. Steps to mitigate

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.

# Method and medium

To be able to visualize popular dive sites, ArcGIS will be used to build the maps. As the project also contains data sets that are to be represented by charts, Tableau will be used to help build relevant charts. For the final project I would use ArcGIS Story Maps to help build the narrative. As I have worked with ArcGIS Story Maps, I am familiar with the interface.

But as this would be a project where I build on my data visualization skills, I want to experiment with Shorthand as well. But as of now the methods and mediuam i would us would be ArcGIS Pro, Tableau and ArcGIS Story Maps.
